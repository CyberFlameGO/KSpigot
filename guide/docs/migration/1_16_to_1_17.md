# Updating from KSpigot for 1.16 to KSpigot for 1.17

## Dependency management

Do **not** use the Gradle shadow plugin anymore! Spigot now has its own library feature, use that one instead. This
applies to KSpigot, but in the best case for your other dependencies as well!

For KSpigot this means, that you have to add the following to your `plugin.yml`:

```yaml
libraries:
  - "net.axay:kspigot:VERSION"
```

Of course, replace `VERSION` with the KSpigot version you are using.

Read the setup guide for more information.

## Removed features

You can no longer await anvil input from a player. This feature was not stable enough to fit in this project.

## Changed

The `Listener.register()` extension function now is no longer available, instead it has been replaced
by `SingleListener<T : Event>.register()`. Don't worry, this means that this change does not affect you if you are using
the `listen` function provided by KSpigot.

KSpigot is now compiled using **Java 16**! Make sure to use Java 16 aswell. Java 16 is now the minimum required version
for Minecraft by Mojang.
